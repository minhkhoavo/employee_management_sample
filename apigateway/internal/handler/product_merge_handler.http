### ProductMergeHandler API Endpoints with Performance Timing
### Base URL: http://localhost:8080
### Both endpoints print execution time to console using fmt.Printf

### 1. Get all products with merged details (Sequential - In-Memory Indexing)
### Fetches all products from SQL DB and merges them with features and product info from DataStore
### Using sequential batch processing with in-memory indexing for optimal performance
### - Fetch all products from SQL
### - Build in-memory indexes for features and product info  
### - Merge products in a single batch
### Response: Array of ProductDetailResponse with merged data
### Console Output: [SEQUENTIAL] Merged XXX products - Time: XXXms
GET http://localhost:8080/products/details-merged
Accept: application/json

###

### 2. Get all products with merged details (Concurrent - Fan-In/Fan-Out)
### Fetches all products from SQL DB and merges them with features and product info from DataStore
### Using concurrent batch processing with multiple workers (fan-in/fan-out pattern)
### - Fetch all products from SQL
### - Split products into batches
### - Fan-out: Send batches to multiple workers concurrently
### - Fan-in: Collect results from workers and merge in order
### Response: Array of ProductDetailResponse with merged data
### Console Output: [CONCURRENT] Merged XXX products - Time: XXXms
GET http://localhost:8080/products/details-concurrent
Accept: application/json

### Performance Comparison Tips:
### - Open terminal and monitor console output while making requests
### - Compare execution time between sequential and concurrent approaches
### - Test with different data volumes to see scalability differences
